# Middleware Java-based System

A modular and extensible **Message-Oriented Middleware (MOM)** implemented in Java. This project showcases advanced concepts in distributed systems, networking, and message protocol design. It supports a drawing and communication environment where clients (users) interact through structured messages and services.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project simulates a full-featured middleware platform capable of:
- Managing client-server connections through socket channels with byte buffers.
- Parsing and routing structured messages by a homemade protocol.
- Providing distributed services (e.g., drawing interactions, message repository).
- Abstracting figures as an example of an app, tools, and protocols for extensible applications.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system is divided into four key modules:

- **`app/`**: Data structures and models related to a drawing app (e.g., `Draw`, `Point`, `Figure`) and figure composition.
- **`network/`**: Classes to handle user roles (`User`, `Admin`) and the underlying network server (`Server`) using a Strategy structure with services (`Srvc`) as policies.
- **`servicies/`**: Service layers such as `SvcMom` and `SvcEditD`, managing communication channels and user actions depending on the policy applied.
- **`protocol/`**: Implementation of the custom communication protocol with message types, headers, permissions, and parsing logic (`Msg`, `Tag`, `Heads`, etc.).

## 💡 Features

- Custom protocol design using tagged and typed messages, used to a better managing.
- Client/server architecture with different roles and services, depending on the app used.
- Decoupled service logic via Strategy and Command architecture.
- Modular and extensible Java codebase, with posibility of mix both different services and extend the app basis applied.
- Strong object-oriented design principles, following Java programming methodology.

## 🧪 Tests

Includes unit tests in:
- `FiguraTest.java`
- `MsgTest.java`
- `UserServerTDraws.java`
- `UserServerTMOM.java`

These demonstrate correctness in geometric figure construction, message serialization/deserialization and service policies applied.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Requirements

- Java 11 or later.
- A terminal or IDE to run Java applications.
- The following libraries (already included in the `lib/` directory):
  - `junit-4.13.1.jar`
  - `hamcrest-core-1.3.jar`
  - `log4j-core-2.20.0.jar`
  - `log4j-api-2.20.0.jar`

### How to Run
Although the project was created to get more further developed, be used as basis code. You can only run the main Server, or tests done to prove that works properly.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nowelito28/Middleware-Java_based-.git
   cd cd Middleware-Java_based-

2. Compile source code an libraries used:
 - Linux/MacOs:
   ```bash
   javac -cp "lib/*" -d out $(find ./src -name "*.java")
 - Windows:
   ```bash
   javac -cp "lib/*" -d out src\app\*.java src\network\*.java src\servicies\*.java src\protocol\*.java
